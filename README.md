# Random Chorale Generator and Chord Ranks with Python/Jupyter Notebooks

In this project I wrote a program that generates random chorales in the style of Bach, using Numpy and Pandas. I also performed a markov chain analysis on the chords. Please see the Jupyter Notebook for a more detailed walkthrough and code.

Here is a link to one of the chorales I generated https://soundcloud.com/kdeuser/random-chorale
